// Define a function named, area_of_rectangle, in C to calculate the area of a rectangle when its length and breadth are given as arguments to the function (assume both are integers).
// The function should return the value of the area (also an integer). Do not print anything inside the function, you should only return the value of area.
// It will be automatically printed by the caller function (in this case, main function (defined by us))
